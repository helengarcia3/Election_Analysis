## Overview of Election Audit

We have succesfully helped Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission but the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit. We will be using the csv for election results and python to conclude the data to answer 
the additional questions the election commission has requested.

## Election-Audit Summary

In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

 Dear election commission, we created a python script to turn the csv of election results in a summary of findings for the Ballot ID, County and Candidate. We were able to summarize county participation, and winning candidate. This code can be updated to read more detailed information to give us quick summary results of future elections other than ones for just county. 
 
An opportunity for improvement is to have more coulumns of data in the csv election results data set, this can help us restructure the code to have more a more detailed summary. Data that would provide value for further analysis would be more detailes on the candidate such as the party they are running for so the result show the winning party as well as the candidate that won. This can help with Geographical stats based on the votes. 
The only votor information in the data is the Ballot ID which does not provide much detail on the person casting the vote. to dig further in analysis, it would help to have the voters demographical information and they party they voted for. 

The python script can be easily updated to summarize these findings for a more detailed dataset and provide a much more anlaytical perspective on the results for the election.
